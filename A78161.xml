         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T appeareth by many Writers of the Common-law; That a Fine is nothing but a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compoſition, or final con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord had between perſons of and concerning any lands or tenements, rent or other thing hereditable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>eſſe tempore finis,</hi> acknowledged and recorded formerly by the conſent and licenſe of the King, now of the Lord Protector, or his Juſtices before a competent Judge, to the end to cut off all controverſies, that neither of the parties litigant from it may after depart. And therefore well may it be ſaid to be <hi>fructus exitus, &amp; finis legis. Plo. fol.</hi> 357. If we but conſider that the Law was made to no other end than to ſettle peace.</p>
            <p>In every Fine there are two ſeveral parties, the Cogniſor, and the Cogniſee, the party levying the Fine is called the Cogniſor, and he to whom it is levyed is called the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee: There are five eſſential parts in a Fine: <hi>firſt,</hi> the original writ taken out againſt the Cogniſor: the Kings licence formerly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, giving the parties liberty to accord, for which he had a Fine called the Kings ſilver,

            <p>There are two ſorts of Fines, the one at Common Law, the other levied and proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med according to the Statute.</p>
            <p>

The other is the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>chap.</hi> 24. being in ſome thing afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by a Statute made in <hi>Anno</hi> 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>chap.</hi> 36. The Proclamations are four, and are to be made four ſeveral Terms, as hereafter ſhall be expreſſed. Concerning Fines with Proclamations, 5 things are to be obſerved. 1 The time of levying &amp; proclaiming the ſame. 2 The place where, and before whom it is to be levyed. 4 What Ceremonies therein are to be obſerved. 5 the ſeveral times are to be obſerved and conſidered Firſt that the Fine be levyed af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er the Feaſt of Eaſter, which was in the year of our Lord 1496. for all Fines le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed before that time are out of the compaſs
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:124146:4"/> of this Statute. 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. as it appeateth by the letter of the ſame Statute. 2 That the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation muſt be made in time of the Term, and therefore if any of thoſe proclamations doe happen to be made, either before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, or after the end of any Term, or on a Sunday, or other feſtival day, exempted from the Term, as on the Feaſt day of the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification</hi> of <hi>St. Mary</hi> the Virgin, <hi>Aſcention day, All Saints, All Soules,</hi> or on the Feaſt day of St. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> if it happen on any other day than on the Friday next after <hi>Trinity Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> and to be recorded accordingly, then if it be not holpen by the Statute of 23. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 3. all the Proclamations are reverſable by a Writ of error, or by plea; as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in <hi>Finches</hi> caſe, <hi>Plow. com.</hi> 266, 267. and then the Fine will be of no other nature and force, than a Fine without proclamations. And albeit the Proclamations were all made within the Terms according to the form of the Statute; yet if the record or records, do pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the contrary, they are reverſable by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, or avoidable by plea, if it be not holpen by the ſaid Statute; for a record is of that credit in law, that no averment may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the contrary.</p>
            <p>A Fine doth for ever conclude, and bar as well privies as ſtrangers to the ſame, except ſuch ſtrangers as are women covert (other than be parties to the Fine) and every other perſon being within age, <hi>viz.</hi> the age of 21 years, in Priſon or out of this Realm, or not of whole mind at the time of ſuch Fine levied. But this exception is conditional, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:124146:5"/> they or their heirs inheritable to the ſame lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do take their action or lawfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (according to their right and title they have to the Tenements therein contained, at time of the ingroſſing thereof) within 5 years next after they be of full age of 21 years, out of priſon, uncovert within this Realm, and of whole mind.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee who are privies, and who are ſtrangers to a Fine, according to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute there are three privities only. 1 privity in blood only. 2 privity in Eſtate only. 3 privity in blood and eſtate.</p>
            <p>There are three kinds of privities. 1 in blood <hi>tantum.</hi> 1 one when a man is heir to his late Anceſtor, and yet hath nothing by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent from him. As for example, if a father ſeiſed of lands in Fee doth thereof infeoffe a ſtranger and his heirs, or if he by his laſt Will and Teſt. in writing did diſpoſe the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holden in ſoccage, to another in Fee, and hath iſſue and dyeth in this caſe, ſuch iſſue is privy in blood, having nothing by diſcent.</p>
            <p>2 Another kind of privity in blood, is, when ſomething is deſcended unto him, as heir un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Anceſtor, and yet he claimeth the ſame by ſome other right; and not as heir to ſuch an Anceſtor. As for example, if there be a Father and Son, and the Son purchaſeth lands of a ſtranger in Fee, and is there of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſed by his Father, who dyeth thereof ſeiſed, &amp; the ſame deſcend to his Son, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> heir in this caſe, the Son is privy alſo in blood, but not in eſtate, for although the poſſeſſion of the ſame land came to him by diſcent, as heir to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:124146:5"/> his father, yet he was therein remitted forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to his former eſtate.</p>
            <p>3 And a third kind of privitie in blood <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> is where a man in ſome reſpect is privy in blood and eſtate, and in another reſpect privy in blood <hi>tantum.</hi> As for example, if there be two brothers, and the eldeſt purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth lands in Fee, is thereof diſſeiſed by his younger brother, afterward diſſeiſed by a ſtranger, and that ſtranger dyeth thereof ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the younger brother being within age, and afterwards the elder brother dyeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iſſue, the younger Son hath two manner of rights to the land, the one is a right of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try againſt ſuch heir as is in by diſcent during his minority, but that right is only in reſpect of his former poſſeſſion, which he obtained by diſſeiſen, and not as heir to his brother, and in this reſpect he is privy in blood to his eldeſt brother, but not privy in eſtate. The other right that is now in the younger brother, is only a right in action, and not a right of entry, and this is in him as heir to his brother, whoſe entry was taken away by the ſaid diſcent, in reſpect of his right, he is privy in blood and eſtate to his brother.</p>
            <p>Privity in eſtate <hi>tantum,</hi> is where a man claimeth an eſtate in land, as aſſignee to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; as if <hi>A</hi> infeoffe <hi>B.</hi> in this caſe, <hi>B.</hi> and his heirs are privy in eſtate to <hi>A.</hi> Privity in blood and in eſtates are of two ſorts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one may properly be called a privity of blood and eſtate, the other is ſo called im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, and in a borrowed ſence. That which is properly called a privity in blood
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:124146:6"/> and eſtate, is when both privities do acrew by diſcent, by or from one Anceſtor. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, when one of them acreweth by one manner of title, and the other by title of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother kind; as for example, if there be a father and a ſon, and the father purchaſeth lands, and dyeth thereof ſeiſed, and the ſame doth deſcend to his Son, he is to his father in a proper ſence privy in blood and eſtate, becauſe both thoſe privities doe to him acrew, by one diſcent from one Anceſtor.</p>
            <p>It is to be noted that ſuch privies as the Statute meaneth are after the ingroſſing of the Fine &amp; Proclam. made according to the form of the Statute, abſolutely barred without hope of recovery or reſtraint, by any claim; but ſuch as are ſtrangers, are barred only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, if they or their heirs, do not claim according to the form of the Statute, within the times therein preſcribed. It is a rule in Law, that no error in the fault of the Judge can be aſſigned to reverſe a Judgement, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it may be tryed by view of the Record, or by inſpection of the perſon; for if it ſhould, many grave Judgements would be overthrown by corrupt tryals of falſe ſurmiſes, to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Juſtice, and maintenance of Vice: But if the Judge give Judgement for the one party, upon the matter appearing of record, whereas he ought to give judgement for the other party, this is reverſible by error, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a fault of the Judge through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Law, is apparent by the view of the Record,</p>

               <p>Wherefore if you would acknowledge your Fine before him out of Court; you muſt firſt draw your <hi>praecipe</hi> and Concord in paper, and bring the parties that muſt acknowledge the Fine, to my Lords Chamber, and deliver your <hi>praecipe</hi> to my Lords Clerk of the Fines, who will read it to them in preſence of my Lord, and their hands being firſt ſet to it, he acknowledgeth it before my Lord, and he putteth his hand to it, for which you pay to the Clerk for my Lords ſee 9 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi>

               <p>The value being ſet down by one of the Commiſſioners, if it exceed forty ſhillings (or elſe there is nothing to be paid) you muſt go to the Receiver in the ſame Office, and pay the Fine ſo aſſeſſed, which is the Kings ſilver for the Kings Licence, which Licence the Clerk of the Kings ſilver entereth; when the money is paid, the Receiver will ſet his hand to the back of the Writ, then you muſt give it to the Doctor to ſign, who hath <hi>4d.</hi> for his hand, then get the hands of the two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to the back of the Writ, which done you muſt carry it to the 3 Clerks ſitting, to be endorſed and entred.</p>

               <p>Since that we have hitherto ſeen how to ſue forth a Fine, let us alſo know what
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:124146:18"/> things hinder the certifying and ingroſſing of Fines knowledged.</p>
               <p>If the Cogniſor dye after the knowledging of a Fine, and before it be ingroſſed, ſuch Fine ought not to be certified nor ingroſſed. 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>f.</hi> 52. 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>f.</hi> 9. In like manner if the Cogniſee die.</p>
               <p>But if the Writ of <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Dedimus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtatem</hi> be returned, and thereupon the Kings ſilver entred, and before the Fine be ingroſſed the Cogniſor or Cogniſee die, yet is the Fine thereof good, and may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be ingroſſed, though it be in another Term; <hi>Haec eſt finalis</hi> Concord. <hi>facta, &amp;c. in Craſtino pur. beatae M.

               <p>And in like manner, if any Commiſſioner or Juſtice before whom a Fine is knowledged, chance to die or be diſcharged of his or their Office, before the Kings ſilver thereof be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, then may a Writ of <hi>Certiorari</hi> be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of the Chancery to the Juſtices diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, or to Executors or Adminiſtrators of ſuch Commiſſioners or Juſtices ſo dying, commanding them to certifie the note of the ſaid Fine and Concord. <hi>Fitz. f.</hi> 174. <hi>b.</hi> 8 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>f.</hi> 5. 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>f.</hi> 9. which being returned the Fine may proceed and be ingroſſed.</p>

               <p> A Fine knowledged of lands holden in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite,</hi> ought not to be ingroſſed before a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of Alienation be ſued out thereupon. 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>f.</hi> 52. and a Writ of <hi>quod permittat fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem levari, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Fine of a reverſion ought not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed until the Tenant for term of life at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, for until atturnment he is diſpuniſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of waſt, neither can the Cogniſee avow upon him for the rent behind before Atturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>f.</hi> 13. <hi>plow. f.</hi> 431. <hi>b.</hi>

               <p>And by the Statute of 23 <hi>Eliz. ca.</hi> 3. notes of Fines and Concord knowledged, for the levying of Fines, are to be certified within one year next after the knowledging thereof, or elſe the perſon taking knowledge of ſuch Fines is not bound to certifie the ſame: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe if it be certifyed afterwards, it is good enough.</p>
